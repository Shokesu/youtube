# YouTube Data Prediction
## Abstract:
Using natural language processing (nlp) and machine learning (ml) Algorithms to parse and classify YouTube comments as positive, negative or neutral

## Goals: 
* Understand how word usage can be indicative of overall user sentiment towards or approval of videos on social media platforms
* Learn about NLP and how computers can be used to comprehend, analyze, and classify human language and emotions through text

## Current Progress: [Jupyer Notebook](https://github.com/UCSB-dataScience-ProjectGroup/youtube/blob/Andies-Branch/Youtube_Classifers.ipynb)

## Method:
1. Extract data from Youtube API using ApiCall
2. Use NLP to tokenize and track word frequencies in comments (using sci-kit learn package)
3. Classify using multinomial naive bayes, support vector machines, and logistic regression
4. visualize results with plots and plotly dashboard (for interactive material)
